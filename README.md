# -A-Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Techniques-on-Instagram-User-Data-

This project applies various clustering techniques to a real-world dataset of Instagram users, focusing on their visit frequency and spending behavior. By using unsupervised learning methods, we aim to identify meaningful user segments that can inform marketing strategies and user engagement efforts.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Instagram Visit Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaandsheikh/instagram-visit-clustering)

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand and segment Instagram users based on behavioral patterns.
- Apply and compare multiple clustering algorithms:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - K-Medoids Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering (Single and Complete Linkage)

## 📌 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Elbow Method & Silhouette Analysis
- Clustering (K-Means, K-Medoids, Agglomerative)
- Dendrogram Visualization

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## 📈 Insights

- Distinct user clusters were identified, such as:
  - High spenders with moderate usage
  - Frequent visitors with low spending
  - Infrequent users with minimal interaction

## 📎 Outcome

This project demonstrates a complete unsupervised ML workflow and highlights the value of clustering in understanding social media user behavior.

## 📚 Learnings

- Reinforced understanding of clustering theory and implementation
- Gained experience in interpreting dendrograms and intra-cluster dynamics
